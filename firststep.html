                <p>Are these questions you ask yourself regularly or the on-going battle in your mind...</p>

                <p>What do I need?</p>
                <p>When should I start?</p>
                <p> I don't even know how to make dough or stretch the dough by flying 
                    it through the air like the pros without it 
                    possibly sticking to the ceiling or falling onto the floor.
                </p>

            <div class="column">
                
                <p> Does this sound familiar? If so, remember that everybody starts at the same place of experience and knowledge.</p> 
                <p> Tell yourself “I can do this”</p>
        
                <p> Make a list with a clear vision of your idea of how the ideal result looks like, this will help you be successful and gain confidence.</p>
                
                <p> Dream of those freshly baked pizzas with melted cheese gently bubbling along with the whole pizza steaming, 
                    to the crisply charred crusts that are great for dipping in chocolate sauce. 
                    Hey presto! You have made dessert also
                </p>

                <p> Refer to our article for the pizzaiolo checklist for ingredients and equipment set up.
                    A good piece of advice is to make sure you know how many pizzas you would need for evening 
                    but maybe even the afternoon, pizza is great anytime of the day.
                </p>

                <p> Always consider making extra dough to be on the safe side. 
                    It could be a disaster to leave yourself short, if all goes well the benefit will 
                    be that there is leftover pizzas for the following day or dough to bake some bread…no one has ever complained about any of those.
                </p>

                <p> After practise and persistance you are totally capable, took me a while to do so and even of times wanting to quit when it has burnt.
                    The pesto and potato pizza took me time to even attempt
